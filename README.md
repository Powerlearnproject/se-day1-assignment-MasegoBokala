Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
An approach to designing, developing, operation and maintenance of a software system. 
Importance:
1. Develop secure systems
2. Impliment encryption protocols
3. Streghthen applications against cyber threats


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Requirements: The process of identifying a project's exact requiremts from start to finish. An understanding of the scope of works. 
Design: The development of the prototype model or visual presentation of what can the product look like. 
Deployment: The exercise of making the application live. Where the hosting is setup and the complted project is deployed. 


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Planning and Anyalysis: Project planning stage where you are gathering the user requirements from your client or stakeholders. Where you evaluate the feasibility of creating the product, revenue potential, cost of production and the need of the end user. 
Requirements: Convert the information gathered from the from the planning stage into clear requirements for the development team. 
Design: The development of the prototype model The original plan and vision are eleborated into into software design document. 
Development: The development team implement the code that make the product. 
Testing: The Quality Assurance team perform validation testing to make sure software/application functions properly and does what its meant to do. 
Deployment: The process of making the software/application live. Where hosting is setup and the project is deplyed. 
Maintenance: A stage for further improvemnt. Troubleshooting and finding solutions. 


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Agile methodology operates on iretative progress through small, manageable uints of work while Waterfall Methodology adoptsa linear and sequiential approach  where each phase must be complted b efore the next one begins. 
Scenario of Agile: Dynamic Environments and continous improvement initiatives. 
Scenario of Waterfall: Preferably for projects with well-defined requiremts and strict deadlines.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer: Create models, diagrams, write code and test software/ applications.
Quality Assurance Engineer: Perform validation testing to make the project functions properly according to the its intended requiremts. 
Project Manager: Responsible for day-to-day management of the project and must be competent in managing the ascpects of the project > Scope, Schduele, Finance, Quality, and Resource.  


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs: Helps programmers develop software code efficiently. E.G AWS Cloud9
VCS: Streamline development processes, enabling faster iteration and delivery of features. E.G Github 


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Keeping up with rapid changes of technology. 
Solution: Adapt, learn continuosly and embrace new technologies. 

Time limitations - Pressure environments, global global time zones, communication and collaborations with lack of resources
Solution: Implement time management techniques. 


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing: Individual components of software are tested. 
Importance > Boosts testing productivity by eliminating defects with the code itself. Can save time and increase test coverage. 
Integration Testing: Individual units are combined and tested as a group. 
Importance > Catches problems earlier in the interface and interaction between components. 
System Testing: Testing of the complete and integrated software system to evaluate its specifics tions with requirements.
Importance > Simulates real world usage and envrionments. 
Acceptance: Validating the software with business requirements to ensure its ready for delivery. 
Importance > Verifies that the system meets the acceptance criteria and is ready for production deployment. 

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering ensures generated content aligns with the designed tone, style and messaging. Ac well designed prompt can guide an AI model to write enganing and informative articles on specific topics, saving time and resources while maintaining quality. 


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
